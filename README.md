#HTML5
In HTML5 some elements were deprecated, some purposes were changed, and some new ones were added.

Among those, there are some elements that are no longer considered part of the language, such as `<center>`, `<frame>` and `<font>`.

The element `<font>`, now usually replaced by the `<span>` element, was used until HTML4 to show text on the screen. Other elements like `<i>` or `<b>`, previously used to emphasize text on the screen, now have a different meaning. While new elements like `<mark>`, `<address>` or `<time>`, for example, were added to provide a better way to describe and represent the documentâ€™s content.
